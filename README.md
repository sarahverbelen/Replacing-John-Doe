# Replacing-John-Doe
## What does it do?
It does what the names says it will do: it replaces John Doe's. Replacing John Doe (RJD) is an API that generates more believable placeholder data so that you do not have to go back to Lorem Ipsum's and John Doe's.  
## Why is it useful?
When you are developing, it can be very helpful to have, for example, a database with data that you can work on. You probably don't want to work on the real data when you're just developing - or you might not have real data yet. This API strives to give you an easy way to quickly have a lot of data to test with, without adding extra work. 
## Getting Started
